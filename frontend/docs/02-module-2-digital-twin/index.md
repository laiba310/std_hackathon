# Module 2: The Digital Twin

Welcome to Module 2: The Digital Twin! In this module, we will explore the exciting world of digital twins – virtual replicas of physical systems that enable us to simulate, test, and interact with robots in rich, physics-accurate environments. We will delve into two prominent platforms: Gazebo for robust physics simulation and Unity for advanced human-robot interaction (HRI) and visualization. Understanding digital twins is crucial for accelerating robotics development, reducing costs, and ensuring the safety of real-world deployments.
