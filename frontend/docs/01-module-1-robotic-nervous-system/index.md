# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System

Welcome to Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System! In this module, we will dive deep into ROS 2, the next-generation Robot Operating System, which serves as the fundamental middleware for building sophisticated robotic applications. You'll learn how ROS 2 facilitates communication between various robot components, from sensors to actuators, enabling complex behaviors and autonomous operations. We will explore its core concepts, integrate Python agents with ROS controllers, and delve into the intricacies of URDF for accurately describing humanoid robots.
